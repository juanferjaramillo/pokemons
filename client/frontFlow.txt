RIDUX STATE

on Cards:

cardsOnGame: ALL cards brought from API in chunks of 60.  Somehow equivalent to the PokeApi.

cardsFiltered: CardsonGame filtered or ordered

cardsOnBoard: all cards currently on display.  It has a maximum of 12 cards.  -Depricated!!

1. SplashPage load:
Loads cardsOnGame from API
dispatch(getAllPks());

2. BoardPage load:
Board component does not modify the state! it renders a map of cardsOnFilter, with the state.page change.

3. All:
Updates cardsFiltered by copying cardsOnGame
which also updates state.page to 1
dispatch(dispAllPk())

4. Filters:
Updates cardsFiltered by filtering cardsOnGame on filter selected
dispatch(filterTypeCards(event.target.value));

5. Order:
Updates cardsFiltered by ordering cardsFiltered by name or attack
------- ESTA FUNCION TAMBIEN ORDENA cardsOnGame (NI IDEA POR QUE) Y NO RENDERIZA LOS CAMBIOS -----
